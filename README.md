Hello! I am Estefania Vazquez. I am currently studying software engineering at McGill University. I am in my 4th year of studies and hope to graduate in the Summer of 2026. 

Some topics I have enjoyed exploring are the Network Layer, Data Governance, and Cloud Infrastructure.

I hope to soon dive into Machine Learning, Data Science, and Cybersecurity.
