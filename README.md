## Academic Projects

### Web Applications
 
🚙 **[McGillParkingLot](https://github.com/estefaniavazquez/project-group-04)**  
A web-based system developed by a team of 6 to manage a parking lot accessible by both clients and employees. Built under an Agile methodology with regular sprint reviews and milestones.

- 📐 Requirements – Defined and modeled requirements for both design and implementation phases; created use cases and architectural diagrams to guide development.

- 🧩 Tech Stack – Backend built with Java; frontend designed with Vue.js (JavaScript) for an intuitive and responsive UI.

- 🗃 Database Integration – Implemented a PostgreSQL persistence layer to manage users, bookings, and space allocation.

- 🕵🏽‍♀️ Testing – Applied TDD principles using JUnit for business logic tests; automated test execution and builds using Gradle.

- 🗂️ Version Control – Maintained clean project structure and version history using Git and GitHub, supporting both documentation and collaboration.


🛍️ **[Listful](https://github.com/estefaniavazquez/Listful)**  
A self-directed full-stack project developed in a team of 10 in an Agile environment using 2-week sprints. The goal was to build a collaborative wish list application from the ground up.

- 📐 Requirements – Gathered user requirements and translated them into Gherkin scenarios, then decomposed them into epics, user stories, and tasks using GitHub Projects.

- 🧩 Tech Stack – Backend built with Python; frontend developed in TypeScript using React Native and Redux for state management.

- 🕵🏽‍♀️ Testing – Followed a TDD approach using JUnit for unit tests and Behave for automated behavior-driven tests.

- 📆 Agile Practices – Practiced agile ceremonies and retrospectives, collaborating closely with teammates to deliver iterative improvements each sprint.

- 🗂️ Version Control – Used Git and GitHub for source control, issue tracking, and thorough documentation across all project phases.


### Game Engine
👾 **[Luminara](https://github.com/LuminaraEngine/Engine)**  
Modern games increasingly depend on hardware-accelerated ray tracing, excluding users with older or more modest setups. Our team wanted to challenge this trend by building a game engine that brings physically realistic rendering to all users, minimizing electronic waste and broadening creative access in the game development community. Luminara is a custom-built game engine written in C++, designed to render realistic scenes using software-based ray tracing and a physics simulator. 

- 🛠️ Core Engine Architecture – Implemented a custom ECS (Entity-Component-System) design pattern to structure the game logic and maximize modularity and performance.

- 🌅 Software-based Ray Traced Rendering Pipeline – Developed a real-time, software-based ray tracer capable of simulating realistic lighting and shadows without GPU acceleration.

- 🧲 Physics Engine – Built and integrated a rigid body physics simulation system, supporting realistic object interactions and movement within the engine. Below is a Cornell Box rendered with Luminara:

- 🛠️ System Integration – Combined the physics and rendering systems into a working engine loop. Below is a demo of the physics and rendering systems applied together:

- 🕵🏽‍♀️ Testing & Debugging – Employed extensive unit and integration testing to ensure each module’s reliability and correctness under various conditions.

- 🧠 Research-Driven Design – Overcame limited documentation on certain rendering and ECS techniques.

- 🤝 Team & Workflow – Adopted an agile-inspired development process. The team was split into subgroups focusing on rendering, ECS, and physics, allowing for parallel progress and cross-functional collaboration.

Luminara represents both a technical milestone and a statement of inclusivity in game development—an engine that opens up the power of ray tracing to everyone, regardless of their hardware.

## Internship Experience

- **Rio Tinto** *(Sept – Dec 2023)*  
  I interned as a Software Development Student, contributing to two web apps and an iOS mobile app. My main responsibilities included implementing new client-facing features (e.g., dynamic tables, data import/export, UI enhancements). All applications were deployed via AWS, and I worked across the stack using Python, TypeScript, and React Native.

- **Nasdaq – Verafin** *(Jan – Aug 2025)*  
  Currently interning as a Software Development Student. My work has included:
  - Writing queries for data validation and generating insights for clients  
  - Enhancing the data quality pipeline to tailor rule-checking logic to business-specific needs  
  - Working within AWS services like Glue, Lambda, and CloudWatch to manage workflows and monitoring
